Hi everyone! This is an online real-time collaborative editor so that you can share your findings or course related material.

You can get pretty creative here; bold or italic format, images, tables, links, lists, quotes, formatted code, todo items and emojis can be inserted in text. Please visit the help page by clicking the `?` icon on top of the page.


Before we start let's get some demographics.

| Question | Yes (in percent) |
|----------|------------------|
| Are you connecting via computer (not cell phone)? | 39 out of 50 (4 out of 11 have computer available)|
| Will you be able to type during class? | around 43 ppl can type  |
| Do you have MS Excel installed in your computer? | 42 out of 43|
| Do you prefer lecturer's webcam to be on during lectures? | 17 out of 50 |
| Do you know most of your classmates*?| 37 out 50 |

- [x] If students don't know their classmates, arrange breakout rooms
